Allrounder
==========

A Bootstrap/LESS version of the Allrounder template originally made by lernvid.com (http://www.lernvid.com/).

It comes together with a plugin which will create a template.css after the template parameters are saved. The awesome thing about LESS and the used compiler is that we can use the template parameters as LESS variables. The plugin will do that and the resulting CSS file will be specific for the template style. After that there is no dynamic generation of CSS files during pageload anymore as everything is parsed and compiled into a single file after the template parameters are saved.
